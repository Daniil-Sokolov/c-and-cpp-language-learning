# week15 Final Project

Final project is our the last project. There are four options for you guys to choose. But of course, if you are able to do more, just do it !

## 1 Option 1: Review

### 1.1 Overview

I think many students did not do your work well in sicily before, or maybe some students did finish the every weeks' subject in sicily but they were not familiar with the relative knowledge. Because of that, this option is called to my mind. I hope most of your guys have a good look of the preview primer knowledge of C++.

### 1.2 Requirements (100pts)

1. Finish the subjects that you have not completed in sicily, or do it again in order to review relative knowledge.
2. Choose 3 subjects in every weeks' homework. Analyze it and write down the pseudocode for every subject you have chose. At the same time, you should summarize it with writing down what konwledge does this subject want to investigate. Please answer all of this in your report.**(80pts)**
3. Write an essay about what have you gained in this semester, and your understanding of C++ and talk about the procedure-oriented thinking.**(20pts)**
