一共三道题，按照我认为的难度已经排好顺序。
     So， enjoy it.
     
     1. Read the C code below, what's the output?
       A. 5  junk value  18
       B. 7  7  7
       C  5  7  7
       D. Runtime Error


```C 
#include<stdio.h>
#include<string.h>
int main() {
    char s[20] = "Hello";
    s[6] = 'U';
    printf("%d  ", strlen(s));
    s[5] = ',';
    printf("%d  ", strlen(s));
    s[18] = '\0';
    printf("%d\n", strlen(s));
    return 0;
}
```

-------------------------------

    2.Read the C code below, what's the correct expression for the function hanoi(n)?
        A.hanoi(n) = 2 * n - 1;
        B.hanoi(n) = 2 ^ n + n;
        C.hanoi(n) = 2 ^ n - 1;
        D.hanoi(n) = 1;
      Notice:
          (a). 2 ^ n = pow(2, n);
          (b). Search the word "hanoi", and think about what is the program doing.
          (c). n is integer and 0 < n < 60.

```C
#include<stdio.h>
long long hanoi(int k) {
    if (k == 1) return 1;
    return 1 + 2 * hanoi(k - 1);
}
int main() {
    int n;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    printf("%lld\n", hanoi(n));
    return 0;
}
```

***Here comes the hardest.
exercise for two dimensional array,as well as for string.***

    3.What's the output for the input below?
      Test Case 1: 011110 001010
      Test Case 2: -10 -123
            A . 00112010 -01230
            B . 11221100 1230
            C . 0011221100 other strings
            D . other value  other strings
      Hint : You don't need to calculate it, you just need an answer.

```C
#include<stdio.h>
#include<string.h>
int main() {
	char s1[1000], s2[1000];
	int num1[1000], num2[1000], ans[2500], i, l1, l2, j;
	scanf("%s%s", s1, s2);
	for (i = strlen(s1) - 1; i >= 0; --i)
	  num1[strlen(s1) - i] = (int)(s1[i] - '0');
	for (i = strlen(s2) - 1; i >= 0; --i)
	  num2[strlen(s2) - i] = (int)(s2[i] - '0');
	l1 = strlen(s1);
	l2 = strlen(s2);
	for (i = 1; i <= l1+l2+1; ++i)
      ans[i] = 0;
	for (i = 1; i <= l1; ++i)
	  for (j = 1; j<= l2; ++j) {
	    ans[i + j - 1]+= num1[i] * num2[j];
	    ans[i + j]+= ans[i + j - 1] / 10;
	    ans[i + j - 1]%= 10;
	}
	if (ans[l1 + l2] > 0) printf("%d",ans[l1 + l2]);
	for (i = l1 + l2 - 1; i >= 1; --i)
	  printf("%d", ans[i]);
	return 0;
}
```

ANS: 1.C 2.C 3.D
--------
EXPLANATION:
--------
T1:
String in C add '\0' at the end automatically;
and the function strlen see '\0' as the symbol of the end of a string.

---------
T2:  
In fact, the program is solving  a problem called "Hanoi Problem",
you may search some details about it.
What's more , the question has provided us with a new method of the problem,
without using the recursion. 
If you understand this perfectly, try to search "Hanoi" in Sicily and have a try.
( Notice that the problem may use some special way to save the answer, just like what T3 is doing.)

--------
T3:
To be honest, the program is a bit of mess, but if you know what it is doing, it will be understood easily.
OK, for the problem, we are calculating a*b, but this time both a, b are extremly big(10^999 is possible), so we use the array to save its digits.
But the question isn't care about this, it only shows the error of the program;
As we can see, the program can't deal with the negative integers, so when it comes, only some junk strings will be put out.
Another test case is about illegal input,  there will be more zeros before it.
