#1. 
As the following code, what is the output of the cide?(  )
```c
int main(void) {
  int a[2][3] = {5, 6, 7, 8};
  int b[2][3] = {{5, 6}, {7, 8}};
  printf("%d %d\n", a[1][1], b[1][1]);
  return 0;
}
```
A.0 8           
B.8 8
C.0 0
D.8 0
##Answer
The correct answer is A.
In the array a[2][3], it was initialized in the way like {5, 6, 7}
{8, 0, 0}.And in the array b[2][3], it was initialized in the way like {5, 6, 0} {7, 8, 0}.This difference is caused by the "{}" in the initialization of b.It can help the array to be initialized the b[3] first and then repeat for twice.
#2.
What is the output of the code?( )
```c
#include<stdio.h>
int main(void) {
  int x, y;
  x = 10;
  y = 10 - x;
  output(x, y);
  return 0;
}
void output(int x, y) {
	printf("%d %d\n", x, y);
}
```
A. 10 10
B. 0 10
C. 10 0
D. compile error
##Answer
The correct answer is D.
In this part, it is something about the actual argument in the function.When we declear the type of the actual argument of the function, we should make sure that each argument is following a specific basic type.Just like "int x, int y" but not "int x, y".
#3.
What is the output of the following code?( )
```c
#include<stdio.h>
void exchange(int ,int);
int main(void) {
  int x, y;
  x = 50;
  y = 10;
  exchange(x, y);
  printf("%d %d\n", x, y);
  return 0;
}
void exchange(int x, int y) {
	int temp;
	temp = x;
	x = y;
	y = temp;
}
```
A. 50 10
B. 10 50
##Answer
The correct answer is A. In the function, the operation of the formal parameter doesn't matter the actual argument in main function.Because it just copy the value of the x and y to the function but not the original argument.We can only change the value of the actual argument in the funcion by the pointer.
