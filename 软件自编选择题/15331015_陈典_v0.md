1、Which statement is right about the following code?

    int i, k;
    for (i=0, k=-1; k=1; i++, k++)
    printf("****\n");

A、The expressions in for statement is illegal.

B、This is a dead loop.

C、This loop will not be carried out.

D、This loop will be carried out only once. 

The answer is B.

Explanation:One of the for statements is k=1, this is anassignment statement,not a judgement statement.

2、If there is a conditional expression:

    (exp) ? a++ : b--;


Which of the following expressions is totally equivalent to the (exp) above?

A、（exp == 0) 

B、(exp != 0) 

C、(exp == 1) 

D、(exp != 1)

The answer is B.

Explaination: When (exp) is true,it means exp == 1
.And when the exp is more than 1,the meaning of it is still 1.Because 1 only means true,not a simple value.Then exclusive method can be used.

3、What is the output of the following codes?

    int x[10];
    int i;
    int count = 0; 
    for (i = 0; i < 10;) {
        x[i++] = ++i;
        count = count + 1;
    }
    printf("%d", count);

A、4
                                                                                 
B、5

C、6

D、7

The answer is B.

Explanation:The meaning of the output count is the times of the loop being carried out.In one time of the loop,the value of i will increase by 2.So after some simple calculations,we can get the right answer B.
