**Notice**  
- In this test, you are not allowed to use any kind of compile softwares.


1.What is the output of the following C codes?   
```
#include<stdio.h>  
int main()  
{ 
  char str[]="a24v3\06ac";    
  printf("%s",str);
  return 0;    
}
```
- [ ] a24v3
- [ ] a24v3ac
- [ ] a24v3\06ac
- [ ] none of above

**answer**
- [x] **none of above**

**explanation**
Although "\0" in a string means stop, if there is any number behind the "\0", it will lead to disorder codes.    



2.What is the output of the following C codes?
```
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
	int i=123; 
	printf("%f",i);
    return 0;
}
```   
- [ ] 123
- [ ] 123.0000
- [ ] 0.000000
- [ ] compile error

**answer**
- [x] **0.000000**

**explanation**
Convert a variable in scanf function may cause a junk value(large data type to small data type).



3.What is the output of the following C codes?
```
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
	int a=2;
	int b=0;
	if(a=b)
	{
		printf("MC\n");
	}
	else
	{
		printf("MD\n");
	}
	return 0;
}
```
- [ ] MC
- [ ] MD
- [ ] MC     
      MD
- [ ] compile error

**answer**
- [x] **MD**

**explanation**
Inside the brackets, a will first get the value of b, which is zero. And then, the value of a will return to the if clause, which is false. If we reverse the value of a and b at the very beginning, the situation will be different. A will get the value 2, which is true. So the output will be MC.
