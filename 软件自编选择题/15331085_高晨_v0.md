2. which option is not right（     ）
#include <stdio.h>

f(5);
}

{ printf(″%d＼n″,n);}

　　A.If only in the main function of function f, only in the main function calls the function correctly f
　　B.If function f is defined in front of the main function , in the main function and then the other functions function f can be correctly called 
　　C.For the above program, compile time the system will prompt error message: tip to the f function repeat instructions
　　D.Function f has no return value, so it can be  defined as type void
　　【C】
3. which option is right（     ）
　　A.Functions  can be defined nested but can't be nested called
　　B.Functions  can be defined nested and can be nested called
　　C.Functions  can't be defined nested and can't be nested called
　　D.Functions  can't be defined nested but can be nested called
