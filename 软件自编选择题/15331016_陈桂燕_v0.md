1 If  x = 1 and y = 1,what is the value of expression ( !x||y-- ) ?

 a)  2

 b)  -1

 c)  0

 d)  1

Answer : d

Explanation : !x = 0, and “y--” shows that the expression get the value 1 then y = y - 1 = 0.  So !x||y-- → 0||1 → 1.

2 What's the output of the following program:

	
    #include<stdio.h>
    int main() {
     int a = 9, b = 3, x, y;
     x = a & b;
     y = a | b;
     printf(“%d  %d”, x, y);
     return 0;
    }

a)  1   1

b)  12  1

c)  1  12

d)  1   3

Answer : c

Explanation : x = a & b = (1001)2 & (0011)2 = (0001)2 = 1;
          
  y = a | b = (1001)2  | (0011)2 = (1011)2 = 12;

3 Suppose c is a character variable, which following statement is correct ?
 
 a)  c = “65”

 b)  c = “A”

 c)  c = 65

 d)  c = ‘65’

Answer : c

Explanation : a、b、d are incorrect expressions.
